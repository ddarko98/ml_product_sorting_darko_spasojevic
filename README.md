# ml_product_sorting_darko_spasojevic
Our goal is to select and create machine learning algorithm that will predict product category based od its name. By following the roadmap we will first gather data, clean it, find columns that are actually relevant for our model (feature engineering), train and finally select our model. We will put our model winner "in the pkl jar". In src/model_testing.py we will test model to see if can successfully predict category based on its title. Test example:

TITLE: iphone 7 32gb gold,4,3,Apple iPhone 7 32GB	--- CATEGORY: Mobile Phones
TITLE: olympus e m10 mark iii geh use silber	--- CATEGORY: Digital Cameras
TITLE: kenwood k20mss15 solo  --- CATEGORY: 	Microwaves
TITLE: bosch wap28390gb 8kg 1400 spin  --- CATEGORY: 	Washing Machines
TITLE: bosch serie 4 kgv39vl31g  --- CATEGORY: 	Fridge Freezers
